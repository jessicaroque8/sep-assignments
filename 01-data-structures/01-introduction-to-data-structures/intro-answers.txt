Q: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
A: Developers can access each data structure by calling any of the methods that are defined for
	the class. Developers can also read the instance variables, but not write to them directly.


Q: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
A: If they wanted to find something in Line, they could use the search method:
	a = Line.new()
	a.join('Emily')
	searched = a.search('Emily)

	If they wanted to find a pixel in Screen, they would need to use the at method:
	pixel = Pixel.new(0, 0, 0, 1, 1)
	a = Screen.new(2, 3)
	a.insert(P, 1, 1)
	a.at(1, 1) <== returns pixel

Q: What other real-world data can each structure represent?
A: The data structure for line could also be used for restaraunt orders. The data structure used for
	screen could be used for a map.
